## Tips

* Commit regularly and often to make sure you don't lose work (or so that you can revert easily if you make a mistake)
* Pair programming is okay to complete the project. If you are pairing to get over a hurdle then note said hurdle in the drills section
* Build and burn this project three times for best results. Each time make sure to complete any drills before beginning the scrimmage again
* Take time to create sub-tasks for each story before beginning
* If you get an error, read the error message carefully before starting to debug
